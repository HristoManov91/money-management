# Family budget management

The idea of the application is to be able to organize and optimize your family budget. You will enter your family expenses, and then inquiries can be made about where it is spent. Also to reduce the amount of discarded products. It will be expanded with functionality for products to monitors their availability and when something ends up reminds us and adds to a shopping list. It will be able to monitor the current brochures of selected brands and be able to notify us when a product that we have added to favorites appears on promotion somewhere.
